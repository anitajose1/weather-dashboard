# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Having an app that shows current and future weather details makes planning a trip easier.

Weather Dashboard is one such application that allows a user to search for a city's weather and get results for current conditions and also view a 5-day forecast. The user's searches are saved in local storage and displayed on the screen so that they can revisit those searches if they wish to.

The app runs in the browser and was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the OpenWeather API.

The deployed application can be viewed at: https://anitajose1.github.io/weather-dashboard/
